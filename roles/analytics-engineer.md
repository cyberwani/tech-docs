# Analytics Engineer

Our Analytics Engineers are our shining light to our sea of data. We want to focus our efforts on the metrics that matter, and are building applications to answer real editorial, product, and business questions.

As an Analytics Engineer, you know most analytics tools are built for e-commerce, but you MacGyver solutions from them anyway. You keep stakeholders focused on the data points that matter. And, most importantly, you are the bug in the team's ear, asking of every product idea, “how can we measure and track if it is a success?”

We expect Analytics Engineers to have an established track record applying analytics to real-world problems. You should be able to design experiments and communicate clearly how given metric X will be able to prove or disprove question Y. If you’re not already super keen on the future of news, you’re looking forward to it.

Practical, demonstrable experience with Python/Pandas or R is a bonus.
