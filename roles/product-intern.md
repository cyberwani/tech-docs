# Product internship
Fusion, a joint venture of ABC News & Univision, is seeking a product intern to join its distributed tech + product team for Summer 2015. Aspiring engineers, designers, and journo-programmers are all encouraged to apply.

Projects you could join:

- Glance, our proprietary analytics & insights engine.
- [Shortcake](https://github.com/fusioneng/Shortcake/), an open source tool that makes using WordPress shortcodes a piece of cake.
- Experiments, our effort to continuously refine and reinvent how we solve core business problems.
- Video experience, our general discovery effort to identify new and delightful interactions for our video content and opportunities for interplay between video and other Fusion content.
- Any of [the open source projects](team-culture/open-source.md) we use and contribute towards.

## About You

You're beginning to think about your first full-time job in digital media, and you're interested in this whole "product" thing. Especially if you could do it for a news company.
 
Maybe you're in college, or grad school. You could be the webmaster of your campus newspaper. The developer of some fun side projects. Or maybe you aren't in school currently, just new to the industry and haven't seen a chance to pursue media tech professionaly yet.

You are comfortable with version control. You have launched _something_ in the past – you can share the permalink and explain your role in the project. 

You probably have some web development experience (any combo of PHP, Python, JavaScript, and SCSS). If you don't have programming experience, then you are probably more of a design-type (user interface/user experience in particular).

Lastly, you [share our team values](team-culture/values.md).

## The Deal

This is a full-time internship with a $800 weekly stipend, or approximately $20/hour for 40 hours each week. 

Because we're distributed, you'll have some flexibility on when those hours happen. However, we expect that the majority will fall during normal east coast business hours (7am - 7pm EST).

You'll also be invited to attend a Fusion meetup or mini-meetup somewhere in the country (details TBD). [Our meetups](fusion.net/list/61358/5-lessons-from-our-distributed-tech-teams-first-meetup/) are pretty cool and we think you'll enjoy the experience – the last one included South Beach, an escape game, a beer garden, and a hackathon. We will pay for your costs.

## The Application

Email [tech-jobs@fusion.net](mailto:tech-jobs@fusion.net) with `Product Internship` as the subject and the following:

- Your resume
- Relevant public social profiles (LinkedIn, Github, Twitter)
- Links to 1 or 2 projects you helped launch (describe your role)
- No more than 300 words on why you want this internship

If you look like a fit, we'll schedule you for interviews with team members (don't worry, our interviews aren't brutal – we'll even provide you with the questions in advance).

We hope to have a decision made by mid-May. Please contact the email address above with any questions.
