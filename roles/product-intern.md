# Product internship
Are you the webmaster of your campus newspaper? 

Do campus newspapers even have webmasters these days? 

Or newspapers?

You know the answers to these questions, because tech + media are your passion. You like where you live and have a good work-life balance already established. 

## The Gig
Fusion's tech + product team is seeking a single distributed product intern to do two things:

1. Help us build world-class media products.
2. Help us design a world-class media product internship.

You should be comfortable with version control. We expect you to have launched _something_ in the past – if it has a permalink and you can explain your role, it counts. 

Web development experience (any combo of PHP, Python, JavaScript, and SCSS) is highly recommended, but not required. If you don't have development experience, we will expect you to be excited about user interface and user experience design.

We'd also like you to [share our team values](https://github.com/fusioneng/tech-docs/blob/master/team-culture/values.md) and are glad to discuss what they mean if you're unsure.

## The Deal
This is Fusion tech + products first internship. It will be awesome, and possibly unlike any internships in the future. That's because you're going to help us design the next one.

This is a full-time internship with a $1,000 weekly stipend, or approximately $25/hour for 40 hours each week. 

Because we're distributed, you'll have some flexibility on when those hours happen. However, we expect that the majority will fall during normal east coast business hours (7am - 7pm EST).

You'll also be invited to attend a Fusion meetup or mini-meetup somewhere in the country (details TBD). [Our meetups](fusion.net/list/61358/5-lessons-from-our-distributed-tech-teams-first-meetup/) are pretty cool and we think you'll enjoy the experience – the last one included South Beach, an escape game, a beer garden, and a hackathon.
