# Frontend Engineer

Our Frontend Engineers own the user-facing experience, both for readers and editorial. We want the reading experience to be insanely good across a variety of screen sizes and platforms. We want the video viewing experience to be smooth as butter.

Responsibilities:
- Help define the architecture for both JavaScript and SCSS.
- Write clean and modular code, and actively retool to mitigate technical debt.
- Apply hacks to improve perceived load time.
- Test across screen widths, browsers, and devices.
- Be a leader in ensuring the code quality of our frontend development.
- Propose solutions for problems editorial and business don’t even know they have.
- Over-communicate, knowing communication is the oxygen of a distributed team.
- Take ownership of, and have a sense of pride in, every Fusion product you touch.

Qualifications:
- Proven ability to ship great features that will make Fusion a world-class media brand.
- 3-5+ years experience doing what you love — frontend development.
- Opinionated about JavaScript architecture.
- Portfolio demonstrating high attention to detail.
- Strong sense of aesthetic a plus.
- Open source contributions a plus.
