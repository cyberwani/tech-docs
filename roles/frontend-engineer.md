# Frontend Engineer

Our Frontend Engineers own the user-facing experience, both for readers and editorial. We want the reading experience to be insanely good across a variety of screen sizes and platforms. We want the video viewing experience to be smooth as butter.

As a Frontend Engineer, you love to apply hacks to improve perceived load time. Chrome Dev Tools is just one tool of many that you apply on a regular basis. Your code is clean and modular, and you actively retool to mitigate technical debt. And, most importantly, you’re an advocate for the “feel” that makes a high-quality product.

We expect our Frontend Engineers to be opinionated about JavaScript architecture. You know how to make the most of SCSS (and no, we’re not switching to LESS). A strong sense of aesthetic is a highly-valued plus.
