# Engineer

Our Engineers are the most versatile. One day you may be working to incorporate analytics into the publishing experience, and another day you may be implementing a new template for long-form articles.

As an Engineer, your PHP may not be as good as your JavaScript, or vice versa, but you’re always learning, applying, and teaching the rest of the team. You’re on the lookout for opportunities to abstract. If it makes sense to add test coverage, you add it.

We expect our Engineers to be generalists with a tenacity for finding solutions.

As our team grows, there will be some specialization. There will also be opportunities to become the leader in the tools you’re most interested in. You have pushed code to production before, and can explain what you did to meet or exceed expectations.
