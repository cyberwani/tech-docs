- Be a go-to resource for the rest of the team needing to solve UX problems.
- Solicit and distill product feedback from real-world users.
- Propose solutions for problems editorial and business don’t even know they have.
- Over-communicate, knowing communication is the oxygen of a distributed team.
- Take ownership of, and have a sense of pride in, every Fusion product you touch.
