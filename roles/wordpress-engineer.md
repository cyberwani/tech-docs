# WordPress Engineer

Our WordPress Engineers work on one of the most ambitious WordPress-based projects in the world. We’re doing things no one in their right mind would think of doing — and we share our successes (and failures) through open source projects, blog posts, and talks at conferences.

In this role, you are a team WordPress expert, providing guidance on architecture and best practices. You amaze the team with how quickly you knock out bug fixes and enhancements, secretly knowing that sometimes it just requires a small filter. And, whenever possible, you turn our improvements into upstream pull-requests to plugins like Fieldmanager and Co-Authors Plus, or to WordPress Core itself.

We expect you to have a deep knowledge of WordPress internals and APIs.  We follow [WordPress coding standards](wordpress-development/coding-standards.md) and expect that you probably do, too. You know when to use an existing plugin, and when to write your own. You can point us to previous open source contributions. Experience working with WordPress.com VIP or as a WordPress Core committer are both considered a plus.
