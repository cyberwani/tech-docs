# WordPress Engineer

Our WordPress Engineer role gests to work on one of the most ambitious WordPress-based projects in the world. We’re doing things no one in their right mind would think of doing — and share our successes through open source projects, blog posts, and talks at conferences.

In this role, you are WordPress experts on the team, providing guidance on architecture and implementation best practices. You amaze the team with how quickly you knock out bug fixes and enhancements, secretly knowing that sometimes it just requires a small filter. And, whenever possible, you turn our improvements into upstream pull-requests to plugins like Fieldmanager and Co-Authors Plus, or to WordPress Core itself.

We expect you to have a deep knowledge of WordPress internals and APIs. You know when to use an existing plugin, and when to write your own. You can point us to previous open source contributions. Experience working with WordPress.com VIP considered a plus.
