# UX Designer

Our UX Designers take our visual brand and run with it. We want to iterate, iterate, and iterate on editorial and reader-facing product.

As an UX Designer, you invent new UI patterns from our existing style guide when no existing elements fit. You’re on the constant lookout for ways we can improve the fit and finish of our products. And, most importantly, you are a go to resource for the rest of the team needing to solve UX problems.

We expect our UX Designers to have a strong sense of aesthetic. You are be an expert user of your wireframe / mockup / prototyping tools of choice. You already know that Photoshop Perfect isn’t reality, and that visual mockups are just a starting point. Experience prototyping with HTML / CSS and making changes with Chrome Inspector is expected.

You should also access the usability of the product you design by defining success metrics, validating and measuring user success. You are an expert in: user research (interviews, focus group), user modeling (personas, scenarios, use cases, user flow), user testing, information architecture, interaction design principles.
