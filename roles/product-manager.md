# Product Manager

Our Product Managers keep the team on track — and help make sure we're working on the most important problems.

As a Product Manager, you are collaborating with executives, audience development, editorial, engineering, and the rest of the product team to figure out what we’re building next, and what we’re building six months from now. You are the primary resource when design or engineering needs you to track down some implementation details. When a feature is ready for shipping, you check out the branch on staging for final QA. And, to close the loop, you keep an eye to our analytics to make sure we’re evaluating impact.

We expect our Product Managers to have amazing attention to detail. You have experience working at startup pace — because it’s a challenge in itself – and you love to be part of a winning team. You are a problem solver by nature. You’re deliberate in the questions you ask, and strong at debugging, QA, exhausting possibilities, and articulating requirements.

Responsibilities:
- Translate user needs and business objectives into intuitive and compelling consumer products used by millions of users.
- Direct and influence an interdisciplinary team of design, engineering, business, marketing, ads, and research to hone and iterate on your ideas.
- Monitor trends and news in the digital news space, monitor usage, and gather feedback from users.
- Be the primary resource when design or engineering needs you to track down some implementation details.
- Create product roadmaps and identify, analyze, and prioritize new features.
- Manage the lifecycle of new programs and projects -- from requirements to launch.
- Communicate product direction to the rest of the company through regular status reports and updates.
- Propose solutions for problems editorial and business don’t even know they have.
- Over-communicate, knowing communication is the oxygen of a distributed team.
- Take ownership of, and have a sense of pride in, every Fusion product you touch.

Qualifications:
- Preferred 3+ years of product management experience in digital media.
- Knowledge of best practices for digital, mobile, and video platforms.
- Desire to be part of a growing, highly motivated, and mission-focused team.
- Very strong communication and organizational skills; listening, speaking, and writing.
- Proven capability of balancing priorities, multiple projects, and tasks, all with amazing attention to detail.
- Problem-solver by nature — deliberate in the questions you ask, and strong at debugging, QA, exhausting possibilities, and articulating requirements.
- Effective and efficient in your usage and manipulation of analytics tools and behavioral research to drive greater understanding of product problems.
