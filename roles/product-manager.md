# Product Manager

Our Product Managers keep the team on track — and help make sure we're working on the most important problems.

As a Product Manager, you are collaborating with editorial and the rest of the product team to figure out what we’re building next, and what we’re building six months from now. You are the primary resource when design or engineering needs you to track down some implementation details. When a feature is ready for shipping, you check out the branch on staging for final QA. And, to close the loop, you keep an eye to our analytics to make sure we’re evaluating impact.

We expect our Product Managers to have amazing attention to detail. You have experience working at startup pace — because it’s a challenge in itself – and you love to be part of a winning team. You are a problem solver by nature. You’re deliberate in the questions you ask, and strong at debugging, QA, exhausting possibilities, and articulating requirements.
