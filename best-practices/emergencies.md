# Mitigating emergencies

## 1. How do we better define what constitutes an emergency and what doesn’t, and communicate this definition to our stakeholders?

Emergencies are:
Issues that block or disrupt the overall viewing / functions of Fusion.net and editors are unable to write and publish.

Emergencies are NOT:
Things that seem out of place or slightly off for a single post or page. These are bugs please make note of them in the #edit-tech room.  

New feature requests or undefined product requests are not emergencies and should go through the process of creating a Trello card to properly document requirements and assign people. Asking in #edit-tech Slack channel can start the process of communicating with the tech team.

Emergencies | Non-emergencies
----------- | ---------------
Fusion.net is down - unable to access the site | Small visual changes e.g. colour tweaks, font size tweaks
Security breach - site is hacked | One off issues such as select videos not playing, and inability to embed media
Blocking issues that prevent publishing - e.g. backend is frozen for all writers  | Locked out of WP account 

## 2. How can we better include stakeholders in the QA process so we don’t miss blockers?

Notify stakeholders early on of changes happening around their specific areas, making clear what and how they will impact what is currently there.

## 3. How should we make sure we have appropriate tech support coverage outside of normal business hours?

Communicate with stakeholders about any specific events we might be holding outside business hours and have 1 engineer and 1 prod manager aware of the event and in a position where if need be they can assist with any problems.
