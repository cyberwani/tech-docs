As a contractor you may book travel and lodging individually and get reimbursed by Fusion if approved by a hiring manager. 
After your trip submit an invoice listing all of your travel expenses and attach a copy of each individual receipt.
Please do not combine travel costs and hourly fee for your work in one invoice.
