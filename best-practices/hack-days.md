# Hack Days

Fusion's technology team holds two hack days per month. These hack days represent space to experiment with the ideas in the back of our heads. Each hack day has a suggested theme like "personalization" or "monetization". Projects which align with KPIs in some way get a huge +1.

Here's our definition of success for hack days:

* Everyone participates in a project (including developers, designers, product managers).
* Each team has a clickable demo to show on the post-hack day hangout.
* Each demo concludes with concrete next steps.

While how we go about our hack days is ever-evolving, here are some tips we've found helpful to make them successful:

* **Prepare in advance.** Do brainstorming and team picking at least a day in advance so the ideas can germinate. Make sure the hack day and before / after events are on everyone's calendars, so they don't get tied up with other commitments.
* **Randomize teams.** Hack days are a good opportunity for the team to work with those they don't normally work with. 2-4 people is a good team size.
* **More structure is better than less.** While we want to keep hack days a space for experimentation and creativity, they go much better when all of the logistical details are nailed down solid
