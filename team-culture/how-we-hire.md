# How we hire

Fusion tech hires differently than most media companies. Rather than a traditional interview process, we start with conversations. If those conversations go well, we offer the opportunity to work with us on a short application project.

We believe the *quality* of software developed is largely influenced by the people involved, and how they operate as a team. Our ideal team member is self-directed, creative, [communicates well](https://github.com/fusioneng/tech-docs/blob/master/team-culture/communication.md), operates effectively in a distributed team, manages their time well, and takes pride in what they do.

### Conversations

We'll chat with anyone who wants to learn about our work. We [publish about our projects and processes often](http://fusion.net/section/tech-product/), and we love talking to others who are excited about this stuff. Not an interview, a conversation. 

As part of this process, we'll also answer any questions you have about [our pre-app form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OAb8FebRcfqCRBHx3CYY1kxibJFw9VORHhV14KLadeI/viewform). The pre-app form can be submitted anytime after your first chat with a Fusion team member. Sometimes candidates will talk to more than one team member before submitting.

The pre-app form pitches a mini-project that will let our team work with you for a brief period of time on a topic of shared interest. Maybe it's an open source project that needs some help finishing a release or feature, a pain point we mentioned in a conversation, a tool you've always wanted to build that sounds friggin' awesome (our words, not yours). The best applications are usually a combination of your idea and our idea, but anywhere along the spectrum is fine.

## Applications

Application projects last 10-15 hours and can be mostly asynchronous. Ideally, you'll contribute to an existing open source project or start a new one. Open source projects are typically easier to scope as standalone because they're less dependent on internal processes. Open source isn't a hard requirement though.

During the project, you'll be using [our Github workflow](http://fusion.net/story/109294/how-we-use-github-to-release-quality-code-at-fusion/) and hanging with us on Slack. At the end of the application, we'll make an offer (or not) and give you some feedback about our thinking.

For us a 'no' usually just means 'not right now'. We believe the media world is small and that the folks who inhabit it level-up at amazing rates. We're also constantly reinventing how we interface with each other and the organizations we serve. We're growing as much as you are and think that these application projects provide a nice, authentic way to hang and work with others in the field.
