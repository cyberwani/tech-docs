# How we hire
Fusion tech hires differently than most media companies. Rather than a traditional interview process, we start with conversations and, if you want, then work together with candidates on short application projects.

### Conversations
We'll chat with anyone who wants to learn about our work. We publish about our projects and processes often, and we love talking to others who are excited about this stuff. Not an interview, a conversation. 

As part of this process, you'll also get access to our pre-app form. The pre-app form can be submitted anytime after your first chat with a Fusion team member. Sometimes candidates will talk to more than one team member before submitting.

The pre-app form pitches a mini-project that will let our team work with you for a brief period of time on a topic of shared interest. Maybe it's an open source project that needs some help finishing a release or feature, a pain point we mentioned in a conversation, a tool you've always wanted to build that sounds friggin' awesome (our words, not yours). The best applications are usually a combination of your idea and our idea, but anywhere along the spectrum is fine.

## Applications
Application projects last 10-15 hours (TK: how can we scalably compensate) and can be mostly asynchronous. You'll be using [our Github workflow](http://fusion.net/story/109294/how-we-use-github-to-release-quality-code-at-fusion/) and hanging with us on Slack. At the end of the application, we'll make an offer (or not) and give you some feedback about our thinking. 

For us a 'no' usually just means 'not right now'. We believe the media world is small and that the folks who inhabit it level-up at amazing rates. We're also constantly reinventing how we interface with each other and the organizations we serve. We're growing as much as you are and think that these application projects provide a nice, authentic way to hang and work with others in the field.

Sound cool? Get in touch.
