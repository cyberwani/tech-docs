# Onboarding Process
Starting a new job can be overwhelming. We want to make your first days and weeks at Fusion as productive and stress-free as possible.

## Communication and Expectations

Communication is the key to everything, and setting clear expectations early on is the best way to start any relationship. We'll make sure you know who you need to talk to to resolve any issues or questions you might have.

Right off the bat, usually on your first day, you'll have a one-on-one meeting with your immediate supervisor. This will give you a chance to ask questions, and give us a feel for how you work and the best projects to get you started on.

## Paperwork: Benefits, Payroll, Tax Forms, etc

HR will be in touch with you to get your paperwork in order for taxes, direct deposit, benefits enrollment, etc. Fusion offers a great benfits package, including medical, dental, vision, and life insurance as well as a 401k retirement savings plan.

A representative from HR will guide you through the process of setting those benefits up. Be sure to ask questions if something doesn't make sense.

## Equipment

We believe in providing all equipment and software you need to get your job done. We will ask you to choose from a selection of computers, and will take a wish list of additional equipment and software with the goal of giving you everything you need, within reason.

Hardware and software requests in addition to the basics (computer and peripherals) will need to go through an approval process. We will do our best to get you everything you ask for, and to cummunicate clearly with you in any instances where we can't fulfill a request.
