# Onboarding Process

Starting a new job can be overwhelming. We want to make your first days, weeks, and months at Fusion as productive and stress-free as possible.

## Before you start

You've gone through our [hiring process](https://github.com/fusioneng/tech-docs/blob/master/team-culture/how-we-hire.md), we've made you a sweet job offer that you're excited to accept, and we've agreed on a start date. Congratulations!

We'll work through the standard hiring paperwork with you and figure out your equipment needs so that you'll be ready to go on day one.

### Paperwork: Benefits, Payroll, Tax Forms, etc.

HR will be in close contact to get your paperwork in order for taxes, direct deposit, benefits enrollment, etc. Fusion offers a great benefits package including medical, dental, vision, and life insurance as well as a 401k retirement savings plan.

A representative(s) from HR will guide you through the process of benefits enrollment. Be sure to ask questions if something doesn't make sense.
 
### Equipment

We believe in providing the equipment and software you need to get your job done. We will ask you to choose from a selection of computers, and we'll take a list of additional equipment and software from you. Our goal is to provide everything you ask for by your first day. Just use common sense and keep it reasonable. An external display for your MacBook Pro: reasonable. A brand new Apple Watch: probably not.

Hardware and software requests in addition to the basics (computer and peripherals, software needed for your daily work) will need to go through an approval process. We will do our best to get you everything you ask for, and to communicate clearly with you in instances where we can't fulfill a request.

## Your first day

You're excited, maybe a little nervous and not sure exactly where to start. No worries! We'll make sure you feel at home and that you have some clear direction.

On your first day, you'll have a one-on-one meeting with your immediate supervisor. This will give you a chance to ask questions, and give us a feel for how you work and ideas for a good project to get you started on.

Communication is the key to everything, and setting clear expectations early on is the best way to start any relationship. We'll make sure you know where to go to resolve issues and ask questions.
 
## Your first week

We realize that during the first week you will be spending a lot of time setting up your equipment, getting familiar with our tools and processes, etc. While we won't expect a high level of production, we believe that jumping in with both feet is the best way to get started. 

We'll work with you to identify a project that is well defined, suited to your abilities, and scoped to a manageable time frame. We want you to have fun and be successful with your first project. Be sure to ask questions and communicate if you're feeling confused or in over your head. Everybody on the team has been where you are at some point, and we're happy to help each other out.

## Your first month

Your paperwork is in order, your equipment is set up just the way you like it, and you've gotten some work under your belt, and ideally you've shipped at least a few pull requests.
