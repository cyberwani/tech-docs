# Mitigating emergencies

1. How do we better define what constitutes an emergency and what doesn’t, and communicate this definition to our stakeholders?

Emergencies are:
Issues that block or disrupt the overall viewing / functions of Fusion.net
ex.. fusion.net is down, site hacked/ security breach, backend is frozen for ALL writers…

Emergencies are NOT:
Things that seem out of place or slightly off for a single post or page. These are bugs please make note of them in the Edit-Tech room. This includes display issues on video/article pages, Minor CSS tweaks, select video not playing, embed issues, being locked out of your WP account.

New feature requests or undefined product requests are not emergencies and should go through the process of creating a Trello card to properly document requirements and assign people.

2. How can we better include stakeholders in the QA process so we don’t miss blockers?

Note when projects are beginning the stakeholders and make sure they are aware with the changes being made.

3. How should we make sure we have appropriate tech support coverage outside of normal business hours?

Communicate with Editorial about any specific events we might be holding outside business hours and have 1 engineer and 1 prod manager aware of the event and in a position where if need be they can assist with any problems.
