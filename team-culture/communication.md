# Communication

Communication is the oxygen of a distributed team. It is critically important to do well.

There are a variety of tools we can use to communicate. For any given conversation, be deliberate about the tool you choose.

Always default to text. Although it takes more effort upfront, text includes the under-appreciated attribute of creating a written archive. The written word can scale to an infinite number of readers.

Use public communication channels unless the discussion topic explicitly needs to be private. [Slack](tools/slack.md) is appropriate for synchronous, ephemeral communication. Make sure summaries and decisions are captured to a more permanent location (e.g. [O2](tools/o2.md) or [Trello](tools/trello.md)).

A Hangout or Skype meeting didn't happen unless someone took notes and posted them afterwards.
