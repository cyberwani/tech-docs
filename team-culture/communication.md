# Communication

Communication is the oxygen of a distributed team. It is critically important to do well.

There are a variety of tools we can use to communicate. For any given conversation, be deliberate about the tool you choose.

Always default to text. Although it takes more effort upfront, text includes the under-appreciated attribute of creating a written archive. The written word can scale to an infinite number of readers.

Use public communication channels unless the discussion topic explicitly needs to be private. [Slack](tools/slack.md) is appropriate for synchronous, ephemeral communication. Make sure summaries and decisions are captured to a more permanent location (e.g. [O2](tools/o2.md) or [Trello](tools/trello.md)).

A Hangout or Skype meeting didn't happen unless someone took notes and posted them afterwards.


At Fusion we have establised a couple of best practices that improve our communication.

* Say hello and goodbye when signing in and out of Slack
* If you're planning to be offline or unavailable during normal hours, letting people know in advance on O2 or Slack
* Try to give a couple weeks heads up for any PTO
* Don't be afraid to tell people about your timeoff and people need to respect that.
