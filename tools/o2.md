# O2

[O2](http://www.slideshare.net/beaulebens/o2-wcsf2013) is the tool we use for _asynchronous_ communication. It's the yin to [Slack's yang](slack.md).

We live in a new digital era where teams can operate effectively from [any location and at any time of day](http://whenihavetime.com/2011/12/14/my-ignite-at-leweb-2011-the-future-way-of-working-the-distributed-company/). All of us have busy schedules, and as a team, we are considerate of each other's personal and professional time. We can operate efficiently and cohesively without mandating fixed work hours or looping dozens of people into meetings that ultimately accomplish nothing.

O2 is a living reference site, designed to allow for archived conversation and collaboration. Too often ideas get lost in email threads or message chats. The hope is that this will serve as a link between Interactive, Design, Product, Tech, and Editorial.

Have a new feature idea? Throw it here with some questions for specific people/departments. See a great product? Drop it in here and tell us why you feel it would be beneficial to Fusion or what aspects would be worth more research, whether long term or short term. Know of a big project on the horizon that involves one of our departments? Write down the timeline and who is responsible for what.

### Unresolved Posts

All too often, discussions are left hanging with no clear conclusion. If your post needs some form of consensus, you can mark it unresolved until the conclusion has been reached:

Marking the post as unresolved marks it unresolved for everyone.
