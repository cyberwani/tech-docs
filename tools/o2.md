# O2

O2 is a special WordPress theme made by Automattic. It's the successor to [P2](http://p2theme.com/). We use O2 as our _asynchronous_ backchannel. It's the yin to [Slack's yang](slack.md).

We live in a new digital era where teams can operate effectively from [any location and at any time of day](http://whenihavetime.com/2011/12/14/my-ignite-at-leweb-2011-the-future-way-of-working-the-distributed-company/). All of us have busy schedules, and as a team, we are considerate of each other's personal and professional time. We can continue to operate functionally and cohesively as a unit, without mandating work start and end times, or looping dozens of people into meetings that ultimately accomplish nothing.

O2 is a living reference site, designed to allow for archived conversation and collaboration. Too often, ideas get lost in email threads or message chats. The hope is that this will serve as tighter communication between interactive, design, product, tech, and editorial.

Have a new feature idea? Throw it here with some questions for specific people/departments. See a great product? Drop it in here and tell us why you feel it would be beneficial to Fusion or what aspects would be worth more research, whether long term or short term. Know of a big project on the horizon that involves one of our departments? Drop in the timeline details and what will be needed from specific team members.

To ensure you stay current on conversations, O2 offers three helpful email subscription settings:
