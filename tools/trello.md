# Trello

Within the Technology team, we use [Trello](https://trello.com/) to keep track of projects and their status.

## Big Project Board

The Big Project Board is our most active Trello board. It contains all of the projects we're working on together.

An ideal Trello card is written in [PRD format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_requirements_document). However, we encourage everyone to use only as much definition as they need. Often, cards are of varying length depending on how well the project needs to be documented.

A Big Project Board card typically goes through this workflow:

1. **Backlog** - The project is established as a reasonable idea, but hasn't been committed to. Note: more speculative ideas live in our Fusion for the Future Github repo.
1. **On-Hold** - When a project is blocked for some reason out of our control, the card ends up here.
1. **Product Definition** - The project is ready for requirements and design, as necessary. Technical requirements are evaluated during the product definition stage.
1. **Up Next** - The project is ready for development, when development resources are available.
1. **In-Development** - Execution of the project is in-progress.
1. **Shipped** - Project has been shipped, and is soaking before evaluation.
1. **Evaluation** - We're looping back on the project, determining how it was successful and where it feel short, and establishing next steps.

## Experiments Board

Our Experiments Board is where we keep track of Product Design experiences being run in Optimizely.

## Tech Blog Board

The Tech Blog Board is where we keep track of the blog posts we're working on for [our section of the website](http://fusion.net/section/tech-product).

Feel free to create cards as you have ideas. Linking to an editable Google Doc from within the card is a good way to offer a scratchpad for collaborative writing/editing. The Fusion art department will help you with art if you find them on Slack. We also encourage trying lists, galleries, and other content types â€“ dog food at its finest.
