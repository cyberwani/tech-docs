# Slack

We use [Slack](https://slack.com/) at Fusion for our synchronous, realtime backchannel. Slack replaces the need for email and facilitates quick exchanges of information between groups and individuals.

Our rooms include:

* #edit-tech - Where editorial can ask questions of technology and vice versa.
* #growth-hackers - The technology behind audience development.
* #gen-glance - Where we talk about metrics and analytics.
* #prod-ux - Where product and UX designers hash out what's coming up. Our Big Project Board Trello pipes in here.
* #tech - Watercooler for the technology team. Great place to say "good morning", ask development questions, etc.
* #tech-deploys - See when code is pushed to production.
* #tech-next - Discussion around blog posts for [our section on the website](http://fusion.net/section/tech-product/).
* #tech-money - Discussion around new revenue development with sales.
