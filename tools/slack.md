# Slack

We use [Slack](https://slack.com/) at Fusion for our _synchronous_, realtime backchannel. Slack replaces the need for email and facilitates quick exchanges of information between groups and individuals. It also acts as a unifying layer for alerts and updates from all kinds of third-party systems, like Trello, Github, Travis CI, and many more. It's the yang to [O2's yin](o2.md).

Our rooms include:

* [#edit-tech](https://fusionnetwork.slack.com/messages/edit-tech/) - Where editorial can ask questions of technology and vice versa.
* [#growth-hackers](https://fusionnetwork.slack.com/messages/growth-hackers/) - The technology behind audience development.
* [#gen-glance](https://fusionnetwork.slack.com/messages/gen-glance/) - Where we talk about metrics and analytics.
* [#prod-experiments](https://fusionnetwork.slack.com/messages/prod-experiments/) - The best improvements are validated in the market.
* [#prod-ux](https://fusionnetwork.slack.com/messages/prod-ux/) - Where product and UX designers hash out what's coming up. Our Big Project Board Trello pipes in here.
* [#tech](https://fusionnetwork.slack.com/messages/tech/) - Watercooler for the technology team. Great place to say "good morning", ask development questions, etc.
* [#tech-deploys](https://fusionnetwork.slack.com/messages/tech-deploys/) - See when code is pushed to production.
* [#tech-errors](https://fusionnetwork.slack.com/messages/tech-errors/) - Bug reporting from production.
